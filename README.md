# todo-app-react

## Objective

The objective of this technical assessment is to evaluate your proficiency in building JavaScript applications using ReactJS. For this assessment you will be required to build a simple todo application using localstorage as your database in order to persist data.

## Requirements

- The application should allow users to add, and delete tasks.
- Tasks should have a title, description, and status (completed or not).
- The status should be toggleable.
- Additionally, the application should persist data using LocalStorage (refer to this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) for the definition of LocalStorage).
- Kindly focus on the ‘functionality’ rather than UI.
- The application should be built using ReactJS using CodeSandbox (link to CodeSandbox [here](https://codesandbox.io/)).
- Please ensure that your CodeSandbox link is public and accessible.

## Timeframe

You will have 72 hours to complete the assessment.

## Assessment Criteria

You will be assessed based on the following criteria:

- Code quality (clean, concise, maintainable)
- Functionality (all requirements met)
- User experience (easy to use and visually appealing)
- Best practices (proper use of ReactJS and LocalStorage)
